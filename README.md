## Introduction
Hi team,

I am Asmiya Banu,I have done this project according my core php knowledge.I face a lot of error while doing this project.It took me lot of time just install the software because my laptop has a lot of software used for different purposes to complete my 4years degree programme.All the software were in my laptop so it was give some errors.finally i was fix the some errors. and I don't have any experience in the Laravel framework.I was learn the Laravel past two days and do this project.It is very easy to understand comparing with other framework because in my previous group project(Hostel Management system) fully depent on php it take three months to do but laravel took me only 1days to do this project so I want to start my career in your company to enhance my skill and knowledge.

I think I will get a good platform to explore my skill and knowledge to contribute to the progress of the organization as well as myself.
If You will give me a chance to become a part of your reputed organization, I will do my best.

However, i will waiting for your reply.....

Thanks team for your valuable time.

With Best Regards From,
Asmiya Banu.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
